Employee Management System

Introduction

I have used HTML, JSP and Java to create this webpage. This webpage gives the basic idea of the operations that can be performed usinf JSP.
I have used JDBC concepts in collaboration with the JSP and HTML. For the basic understanding I have imported java code in the 
JSP making it a front-end designing and coding website. 

Features

This project will demonstrate how one can switch from one page to another using JSP while establishing a connection to the database. I have used CSS file to bring in the 
style of the website. Apachey tomcat 8.5 is used with latest version of Eclipse Oxygen.
