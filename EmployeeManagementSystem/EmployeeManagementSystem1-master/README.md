# Employee Management System

Introduction

I have created this webpage using HTML, JSP, and Java. It provides an overview of the operations that can be performed with JSP. By integrating JDBC concepts with JSP and HTML, the page facilitates a basic understanding of embedding Java code within JSP, making it a comprehensive front-end design and coding project.

Features

This project showcases the ability to navigate between pages using JSP while connecting to a database. I have applied CSS for styling, and the development environment includes Apache Tomcat 8.5 and the latest version of Eclipse Oxygen.
